1. 	Throw in freq counts that are >= zeta, as opposed to the paper which uses
“>zeta”.
    (easy to flip, no flag needed, except minor edits to memory allocation).

2.	Instead of taking the eps2_c*w_0*num_docs/2*num_topics - ranked element from
    each cluser as the relevant count for the catchword, can we try the
    "eps2_c*w0/2*cluster_size" ranked count?
